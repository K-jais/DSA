class Solution{   
public:
    //Function to partition the array around the range such 
    //that array is divided into three parts.
    void threeWayPartition(vector<int>& array,int a, int b)
    {
        sort(array.begin(),array.end());
    }
};

It can also be done with the quick sort technique of two pointers.
